// # 45 Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.

function carInfo(manufacturer: string, modelName: string, ...others:[string, any][]):object{
    let car = {manufacturer, modelName}
    others.forEach(([key, value]) => car[key] = value)   
    return car
}
console.log(carInfo("Toyota", "Corolla", ["color", "black"], ["year", 2022]));
console.log(carInfo("suzuki", "swift", ["color", "white"], ["year", 2020]));
